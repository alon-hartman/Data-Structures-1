In this excercise we were asked to create a data stracture (PlayersManager) which manages players in a tournament:
Each player is assigned to a group and given a level, his level can then be increased, and in addition groups can be merged (using ReplaceGroup).
Complexity requirements can be found in dry.pdf (in hebrew).
We implemented the data structure by using AVL trees. A generic AVL tree implementation can be found in AVLTree.h.
