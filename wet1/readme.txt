In this excercise we were asked to create a data stracture (PlayersManager) which manages players in a tournament:
Each player is assigned to a group and given a level, his level can then be increased, and in addition groups can be merged (using ReplaceGroup).
Complexity requirements can be found in dry.pdf (in hebrew).
We implemented the data structure by using AVL trees. A generic AVL tree implementation can be found in AVLTree.h.
Please take notice that the focus of this course is to practice data structures and not writing code. With the limited time we were given to finish this exercise, 
and taking into account other exercises from other courses, we could not write code up to the standart we expect from ourself. We did not have the time. This mostly
includes getting rid of duplicated code by using generic functions. However this code passes all tests with no memory leaks or warnings from gcc or valgrind and thus meets this course's requirements.
